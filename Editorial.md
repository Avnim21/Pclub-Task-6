Hint:
Check the danger level then check for cost effective path by comparing demolishing + rebuilding cost and maintaining cost(if danger level >8).
Tutorial:
1) Write the code to input the data.
2)Check the danger level for each building and accordingly decide to demolish the building.
3)If the danger level<7 go for cost effective solution(either demolish and rebild or maintain).
4)Print the costing required for the optimum solution.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
